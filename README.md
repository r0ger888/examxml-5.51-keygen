This algo consists of the following:

**?A?A?A?A?A?A?A??????**

the "?" highlighted with red indicates the chars that are generated from the name buffer with its custom charset : 
```
MOYL0PIXL4AC65US19QHZDV2S8GTRW3FRJB7JEKN
```

and the "A" highlighted with blue indicates the hardcored chars (can be any char u want) from the ASCII table. 
e.g.: i chose PRFKLAN , which is :
1. 50h (P) , 
2. 52h (R) , 
3. 46h (F) , 
4. 4Bh (K) , 
5. 4Ch (L) , 
6. 41h (A) , 
7. 4Eh (N). 

But these chars were set only on the odd-numbered positions of its serial format , until it reaches to the 13th position and from the 14th position it goes with the generated chars from the respective charset.
